           My criticisms and praises for the course, CS347. Overall I think the structure of the course was very well defined and implemented. I believe that having students teach themselves at home, then work on a lab relevant to that topic in class is a very beneficial way to teach and reinforce. The assignments were all helpful and relevant to course material, and the instructor was especially beneficial during in class help. The only reccomendations I have for next semester are as follows: firstly, labs should be simplified, secondly less time should be spent on html/css, placing emphasis instead on servers, creating websites, react, node, javascript, etc. My reason for suggesting simplified labs is because I often found that I didn't have ample time in class to complete the more challenging labs, and while I was able to have the professor help with bugs/impasses I hit early on, I found that there was still much left in the lab which I hadn't been able to complete and learn to implement. My reccomendation would be to provide basic starter code for the labs (stubbed methods, prefilled html/css), so that students have a frame to build off of, and hopefully allows students to dedicate more time and questions to complex aspects of the readings. My second reccomendation: spending less time on html and css, is simply because I believe those are far easier to learn and figure out on your own, and especially as the semester progressed, I felt as if the material was accelerating beyond what I could keep up with, as the latter chapters are significantly more difficult and complex than the early ones. Those are my only reccomendations to better help students in the future. Again, overall I found the course challenging, enjoyable, and productive, however I could see this course becoming even better with the suggestions mentioned being implemented.
