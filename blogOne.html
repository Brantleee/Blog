            Leading up to Blog Post 1 I had no experience with HTML, and now thanks to CS347 I have begun to experiemnt and understand it! During our first few weeks of class we learned a plethora of things, focusing primarily on lists, different types of headers, how to display code, how to link to a website, and how to link to an anchor! The most interesting of these was how to link to an anchor on the current page, as this has so many applications.
